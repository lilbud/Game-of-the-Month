# Metroid 

**Developers: Nintendo R&D1,Intelligent Systems**

**Publisher: Nintendo**

**Platform: NES**

Despite having 4 hit games up until this point, Nintendo felt that they needed one more franchise to neglect. They created Metroid, a game shows that even Space Jellyfish are evil. Our hero, Samus Aran, fights the Space Pirates and their leader, Mother Brain. Exploration is done in a non-linear map with many twists and turns. This game sparked off an on-going but neglected franchise and a rabid fan base who will get angry at any period of time between releases, but enough about Earthbound. Lets get back to Metroid.
