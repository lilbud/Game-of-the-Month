# Super Mario Bros 3

**Developers: Nintendo R&D4**

**Platform: NES**

Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in 1988 for the NES and Famicom. This is widly considered not only one of the better Mario games, but one of the best games period. It introduced many staples to the series that we are thankful for. Such as the World Map and the Koopalings. This game is of your typical Mario fashion, stomp goombas and turtles while progressing towards the end flag. No use reinventing the wheel here. Just go through the worlds and defeat the Koopalings and then Bowser himself. (By the 3rd game, you should've figured out the pattern by now.) Letsa get to the cheevos!
