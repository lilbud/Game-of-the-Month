​	Pokémon Fire Red/Leaf Green was released in early 2004 in Japan and Late 2004 in all other regions. These games were remakes of the 1st gen of Pokemon, (Red/Blue/Green/Yellow.)

​	The Pokémon games need no real introduction. Get animal, train it to kill, ravage the landscape until you are on top...Well, not exactly like that. Same idea, just not as violent. 

​	You do get to choose between 3 different Pokémon which one will be your best friend for the next 40 hours. You have the choice between 3 different types; Fire, Water, and Grass. Your a-hole of a "friend" will pick the immediate opposite. Therefore giving him the advantage when you fight him. The whole game functions around a rock-paper-scissors system. Water > Fire, Fire > Grass, Grass > Water (I know it makes no sense, just go with it). 

​	Your main goal in Pokemon is to "catch 'em all" as the tagline implies. With 151 to catch in the Kanto region alone (and 386 if you want to cross over to Ruby/Sapphire). Though getting them all is a challenge, it is more of a self-imposed one. You don't have to collect all 151 to beat the game. If you wanna be the very best, look below for the challenge.

P.S. If you want, you can play Leaf Green instead. They are fundamentally the same game with the same achievements.

# Game of the Month Challenge

The challenge for this month is [The Real Champ I](http://retroachievements.org/Achievement/33613) You just have to defeat the Pokémon League Champion. I picked an easier challenge because we have several players on the forum who are either trying Pokémon for the first time or giving the series another try. Don't want to alienate them. 

Have fun, and don't take any crap from anybody.
