# RetroPie Game of the Month

This repository will hold files related to the Game of the Month competion on the RetroPie Forum as well as the RetroPie subreddit. This is where I will store info files on the game, a backup of the forum/subreddit post, and the art packs (overlays, boxart and launching images.) 

Just making this so I have somewhere in the cloud I can work on these from wherever I am.
