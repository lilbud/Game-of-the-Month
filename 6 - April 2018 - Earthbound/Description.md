# Earthbound / Mother 2

**Developers: 	Ape, HAL Laboratory**

**Publisher: Nintendo**

**Platform: SNES**

*THIS GAME STINKS!* This was Nintendo's plan to make this game a success, instead, they ended up making box forts in Sears-Roebuck and KB Toys. Earthbound, also known as Mother 2 in Japan, was released in 1994 in Japan and one year later in the U.S. Europe didn't get this game until much later. This game was released to mixed reviews back when it was released. Reviewers thought the game was too simplistic when compared to other games released at the same time, like FF3/6 and Secret of Mana. The bizarre promotional strategy of saying the game stunk while providing scratch n' sniff stickers didn't exactly play out like they thought. Sure the game had it's defenders at the time, but it was mostly pushed to the wayside for a number of years. The game has everything you could possibly want; obsessive cults, zombie circus town, crooked police officers, what more could you possibly want from a video game. Earthbound has gained a cult status over the years. Leading to numerous conventions and projects. The community also translated the games sequel, Mother 3, when Nintendo was very reluctant to publish it. Grab your baseball bat and your trusty Yo-Yo, it's time to go.
